Welcome to the Automated Suspicious Activity Detection for Small Businesses Project!

This project is designed to help small businesses detect suspicious activity using a Raspberry Pi and a camera module. 
In this guide, we will walk you through the steps to set up and run the project.

Hardware Requirements:
1. Raspberry Pi (with camera module)
2. Laptop or server for data processing and storage

Software Requirements:
1. Python 3.x
2. Flask
3. FFmpeg
4. OpenCV
5. NumPy
6. psutil

Project Structure:
- static: contains static files, including CSS, JavaScript, and images
- templates: contains HTML templates for the web interface
- uploads: contains uploaded video files






Future Development:
1. Improve the accuracy of the object detection module using more advanced machine learning models and audio analysis
3. Implement additional features, such as motion detection and facial recognition.
4. Develop a mobile app for users to receive notifications and view video footage on-the-go.
