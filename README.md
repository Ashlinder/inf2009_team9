## Setup:

To run, create a virtual environment, install Flask to run.

1. `python3 -m venv venv`
2. `source venv/bin/activate`
3. `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`
4. `python3 httpServer.py` 



Welcome to the Automated Suspicious Activity Detection for Small Businesses Project!

This project is designed to help small businesses detect suspicious activity using a Raspberry Pi and a camera module. 
In this guide, we will walk you through the steps to set up and run the project.

Hardware Requirements:
1. Raspberry Pi (with camera module)
2. Laptop or server for data processing and storage

Software Requirements:
1. Python 3.x
2. Flask
3. FFmpeg
4. OpenCV
5. NumPy
6. psutil

Project Structure:
- static: contains static files, including CSS, JavaScript, and images
- templates: contains HTML templates for the web interface
- uploads: contains uploaded video files
